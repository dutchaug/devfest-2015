  description: "You want your Android app to be delightful to use. You want your app to feel playful, tactile, as if the whole screen is responding to your actions. Maybe you'd like your Toolbar to respond to scrolling by changing size or hiding. Or perhaps you'd like your floating action button to move out of the way when a Snackbar comes in. Sounds great, but you know what it also sounds like? A lot of work.<br/><br/>Luckily, you have CoordinatorLayout to solve this problem. In this talk, I will demystify this new tool. What does CoordinatorLayout do? When should you use it? How can you customize it?"

  title: "Getting Started with Continuous Delivery for Android"
  description: "Continuous delivery is a popular practice in the world of web apps and server software.  This lets companies push new features to customers more quickly, turn around bug fixes faster, and gather user feedback more regularly.  But what about doing this for mobile apps?<br/><br/>Whether you’re working closely with a client who always wants to test the latest build on their phone, or you want to get updates to QA or external beta testers ASAP, being able to automate the build and distribution process entirely is not only a great time-saver, but it also helps to ensure the quality and consistency of your releases.<br/><br/>In this talk we will take a look at how Jenkins, the popular continuous integration server, can help on the path to continuous delivery.  Topics will include automatically setting up Android build machines, ensuring traceability of apps, finding and reporting on potential code problems, running automated app and stress tests, followed by deploying your app — all with minimal effort.<br/><br/>With live demonstrations, we will see that this can be easier to set up than you might think.  Getting your new features into the hands of users should never be more than a `git push` away!"

  title: "Building a Design SDK with Polymer"
  description: "Collaboration between designers and developers is broken. We’re so used to the unidirectional delivery model from designer to developer; the designer draws a picture, the developer builds the things from the picture. But it’s seriously limiting how we iterate. Also our software architecture doesn’t seem to adapt well to the always evolving design vision.<br/><br/>So we’ve been looking for a shared language. Asking designers to write code isn’t the solution. We don’t want designers to worry about technology, which is distracting from the creative process. Style guides don’t solve the problem either, as they rely on you to go hunting for what you need. If it seems faster to reinvent the wheel, people will do exactly that, and you can’t really blame them.<br/><br/>In this presentation I will address how we can:<ul><li>Align design and development vision, and truly iterate on changes together instead of in separate channels.</li><li>Boost each others productivity by moving away from the unidirectional designer-to-developer delivery model.</li></ul>Let’s leverage Polymer to build an SDK that gives designers and developers easy access to just the things they need. Using tools that make it possible for everybody to share with everybody, not limited by design software or the learning curve of technology."

  title: "Making the Most of UI-Router"
  description: "Breaking down a Single Page Application into states is highly advisable, benefiting both the user and the developer. It allows maintaining an organized structure of the application code, increasing productivity and testability. It also enables navigating directly to states, whether static or dynamic, giving the users the option to save and share them.<br/><br/>UI-Router is a routing framework vastly used in AngularJS applications. It is highly flexible, providing several methods for registering states and routing between them. Among its strengths are the abilities to define nested states, control different parts (views) within one state, store visible and hidden state arguments, and perform actions at different routing stages.<br/><br/>In this talk I will share my experience of building and refactoring stateful applications in AngularJS. Presenting several strategies for defining states and performing navigation, we will discuss how different methods may affect further development of the application. I will propose routing best practices, relating to the following cases: nested and sibling states, absolute and relative routing, stateful directives, and navigation-triggered actions."
