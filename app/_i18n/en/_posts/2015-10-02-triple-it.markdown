#### Introduction

As you all might very well know GDG DevFest has always been a free event and as far as Google is concerned and as long as we can find community friendly sponsors we can continue to organize regular meetups and keep our ever growing GDG DevFest free. We'd like to highlight and thank Triple IT for supporting this event as Platinum Sponsor. On behalf of the organizing team and our attendees we want to say thanks much for your support in making this the best... DevFest... EVER!

Creativity and ingenuity are vital components when we join forces with other global partners such as Vodafone (My Vodafone), RTL (Telekids XL, Videoland, Dance Dance Dance), Heineken (hosting and Virtual Reality) and Talpa (Utopia) to create new products and services. 

With more than 100 enthusiastic colleagues, Triple IT is a lab for innovation to inspire our partners and create products and services we love ourselves. More than an ambition, it is a mindset. One that also makes us a fan and proud supporter of the GDG DevFest 2015.
