        <title>Triple IT: driven by a passion for technology</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you all might very well know GDG DevFest has always been a free event and as far as Google is concerned and as long as we can find community friendly sponsors we can continue to organize regular meetups and keep our ever growing GDG DevFest free. We’d like to highlight and thank Triple IT for supporting this event as Platinum Sponsor. On behalf of the organizing team and our attendees we want to say thanks much for your support in making this the best… DevFest… EVER!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;about-triple-it&quot;&gt;About Triple IT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/TripleIT_Pand.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;padding-top:0px;padding-left:20px;margin-top:0px&quot; /&gt; At Triple IT we are driven by a passion for technology and innovation. We create our products from an intrinsic motivation and belief. Our service is complete: from concept and strategy to design; from apps to optimization, Virtual Reality and from maintenance to hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/TripleIT_Oculus.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;padding-top:5px;padding-right:20px;margin-top:0px&quot; /&gt; Converting video formats, streaming over wireless/fixed networks and creating innovative multimedia applications are fields in which Triple IT excels. Creativity and ingenuity are vital components when we join forces with other global partners such as Vodafone (My Vodafone), RTL (Telekids XL, Videoland, Dance Dance Dance), Heineken (hosting and Virtual Reality) and Talpa (Utopia) to create new products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more than 100 enthusiastic colleagues, Triple IT is a lab for innovation to inspire our partners and create products and services we love ourselves. More than an ambition, it is a mindset. One that also makes us a fan and proud supporter of the GDG DevFest 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.utopiatv.nl&quot;&gt;Utopia&lt;/a&gt; is a very popular real life TV show in The Netherlands and is produced by Talpa. Triple IT built the companion app where you can keep an eye on the inhabitants via various live video streams. In this presentation I’ll show you how they have build the Utopia companion app, taking into account a roll out into several countries.”&lt;/em&gt; Learn all about the nitty gritty, the pitfalls and the various technological challenges and their solutions in Hans’s case study session about building Utopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/hans.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;margin-top:-20px; margin-left:10px&quot; /&gt; Hans originally started as a C++ developer on the Windows platform. He played with M3 and M5 emulator previews for a side project. Hans started developing for Android when the G1 arrived and never looked back. He learned by making mistakes. Hans has an interest in creating new and fun designs. These days Hans needs to split his time between the various Triple IT projects and creating the best OTT television experience with Vinson.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Changing the Perception of Women in Tech</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed we’re promoting tickets for women in tech. Why’s that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;women-are-underrepresented-in-it&quot;&gt;Women are underrepresented in IT.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When tickets first opened up for DevFest, only 21 of the first batch of 300 tickets were registered by women. If that wasn’t bad enough, two cancellations brought that number to a meager 6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cause of this seems to resonate with the lack of diversity in academia and the workplace in the Netherlands. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vhto.nl/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Cijfers_en_onderzoek/20150605_Gediplomeerden_totaal_htno_per_opleiding_1415.pdf&quot;&gt;According to VHTO (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, only 3.5% of students studying computer science in 2014 at a professional level are women (30 of 861), with a more startling number of 2.7% (8 of 297) in technical computer science. While slightly better at academic level (7.4% and 6.8%, respectively), one can nevertheless only ponder the reason of this imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While opinions may vary, there are a few different reasons why we and others think that gender diversity is important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Diversity of thought and essential skills, as women bring different perspectives and knowledge. There is a pool of talent with experience and expertise that has remained almost untapped.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changing the perception of which interests males and females are &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; to have addresses a much larger problem of the mismatch between equal levels of capability and achievement in math and science, and the very different career choices men and women make. Research has shown that parents provide boys and girls with different experiences through the toys they receive and the ways in which praise is given.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encouraging role models to show that computer scientists can put their skills to the greater good can encourage adolescent females to consider it as a field that has a large societal impact. It has been shown that this demographic leans towards biological and medical sciences for this very reason.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Females tend to have higher social intelligence, working better in teams and leading teams than their male colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, better balanced product teams tend to produce products with a competitive edge that are suited to a larger portion of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more detailed explanation about the diversity of experiences, ideas, and social intelligence, and a detailed response to various criticisms of positive discrimination is addressed in &lt;em&gt;A Practical Guide to Gender Diversity for Computer Science Faculty&lt;/em&gt;, in chapter 2, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/undergraduate/CMSC304/Fall2014/PracticalGuideGenderDiversity-Ch2.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is Gender Diversity Important?&lt;/em&gt; (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-can-we-do-to-help&quot;&gt;What can we do to help?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that a primary cause is perception. A vicious cycle occurs when a gender gap forms, where one group perceives a particular profession as unfavorable. We’ve seen the number of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) on a steady decline since the mid-1980s, and the problem couldn’t become much worse before hitting absolute zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sizable event in technology, we found it in part our responsibility to encourage diversity at GDG DevFest The Netherlands. We’ve taken three distinct approaches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing women an extra opportunity to obtain much wanted tickets to increase female attendance (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/gdg-devfest-the-netherlands-2015-tickets-18232000404?access=women-in-tech&quot;&gt;the promo code is still available!&lt;/a&gt;);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arranging for WTM Thessaloniki member Victoria Sinikliyski to address the topic during a heartfelt speech during the afternoon break;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encouraging women to speak up and be role models to inspire others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been made possible through the efforts of our committee members and with thanks to the following women communities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-Women-in-Technology/&quot;&gt;Amsterdam Women in Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Geekgirls-Enschede/&quot;&gt;Geekgirls Enschede&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesAMS/&quot;&gt;PyLadies Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Women-Techmakers-Dusseldorf/&quot;&gt;Women Techmakers Düsseldorf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Dusseldorf-Girl-Gone-International/&quot;&gt;Düsseldorf Girl Gone International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/GirlsCodeEU/&quot;&gt;Girls Code Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-can-you-do-to-help&quot;&gt;What can you do to help?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be welcoming of diversity! Encourage friends and colleagues to join in community events. By involving women in developer communities we can begin to change the perception of our industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to women: speak up! Get involved with events like DevFest by submitting an abstract of a topic that you’re passionate about, or volunteer to participate in organizing community events like these. As Chiu-Ki Chan writes in her blog post about Droidcon NYC, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.sqisland.com/2015/08/droidcon-nyc-22-percent-female-speakers.html&quot;&gt;there’s no excuse not to&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-to-2016&quot;&gt;On to 2016!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While our initiatives from this year are paying off already—female attendance has risen from 6% to 18%—we intend to continue to make strides within our communities to close the gender gap.&lt;/p&gt;
